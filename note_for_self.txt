steps for readme

requirements, need postgres

1. run bundle exec rails db:create


urlshortener

the goal is to create a redirect center
for example:

my app processed url, www.youtube.com, as somedomain.com/#{unique random generated string}
for our example, let’s say this is lala.com/l2faS2r
and stores in URLS table

URLS
——————
id
——————

original_url (
	- a decision i’m going to have to make it whether to enforce unique original_url
		1. IF I DO ENFORCE uniqueness of original_url, the original data will be saved until expiration date 		and the shorten link will be recycled until then
		2. IF I DO NOT ENFORCE uniqueness of original_url, i will have a lot of instance of URLS with the 		same original_url but different shortened_url

		LET’S GO WITH 1 FOR NOW
———————
shortened_url (has to be unique)
click_count (default 0)

features
1. process a url into a shortened link and return shortened link
2. when someone access a shortened link, redirect the user to the original url
now someone clicks on lala.com/l2faS2r
    1. it will hit my rails server
    2. asks rails server, which what is the original link of lala.com/l2faS2r?
    3. rails will check database and grab row with shortened_url
    4. redirect user to the original_url of that row
    
let's work on the backend first then frontend
